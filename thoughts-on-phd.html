                    <p>The following are a collection of thoughts on successfully pursuing a PhD. Note that I do not consider myself especially good or qualified for this, but rather incredibly lucky for many chances that were given to me. My hope is that this can help a few new grad students that might get stuck or are overwhelmed during their PhD. </p>

                        In particular in the beginning of my PhD, one thing I was able to get right was to be open-minded to different research directions, talks, projects, etc., and to try to use chances that were given to me. For you, this could be joining a research project, joining conferences / summer schools / meet ups, giving a talk, giving poster presentations, etc. - anything that allows you to learn something, expose yourself to the field, or to make connections.  
                    </p>

                        Luck is almost always involved in successful careers - just consider the number of people on this planet! It is inevitable that you need luck, but it is up to you to be prepared for it and use your chances.

                    <h4>Identify an area that interests you that is not too narrow and not too general.</h4>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Personal View:</span> 
                        In my case, before starting my PhD, I thought “3D stuff” is interesting which was way too general. But after the first few months with great advisors, my area has become investigating neural fields as 3D representation which seemed to be a good compromise. I was able to build up enough expertise to lead interesting investigations, but it was also general enough that some people cared about the findings. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">High-Level View:</span> 
                        Finding a good compromise of the two extremes maximizes your chances to have a high impact on the field. Being narrow enough is important so that you can build up more expertise than most people in the field. Being general enough is important so that people actually care about your work.

                        In my first co-author project, we spent a lot of time properly implementing baselines; this took a lot of time, and it was nothing to impress the reviewers. However, after a few months, many papers re-used our implementations for their comparisons. As a result, we were able to create value and have an impact with something that didn’t provide a short-term reward.

                        Local minima are seldom global minima. People value true contributions, and they often take time, effort, and hard-work.   
                    </p>

                    <h4>Prioritize learning and finding insights over the method's performance.</h4>

                        In my first project, I remember how important I thought “beating” the other methods in some metric is. When I presented the work, nobody asked a single question about the comparison - they were much more interested in where the approach works well, where it fails, etc. From there on, I very rarely included any quantitative results on my slides, and not once people asked about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">High-Level View:</span> You are part of a community that pushes the boundaries of current knowledge. These people are eager to learn how things work, how it connects to previous approaches, and how they can align their current understanding to your findings. A bold number of a possibly flawed metric is usually nothing you can learn a lot from. 
                    </p>

                        I ended up having regular contact with many people I met early on, the authors we compared our methods to, the authors who compared against our methods, etc. These people helped me to understand things better, to find good internship opportunities, and much more. Further, it’s just much more fun if you meet “friends” instead of “competitors” at your next conference. This also translates to other areas like paper writing. Is “X completely fails on all datasets”, “We are the first one to …”, “We significantly outperform everyone on all metrics” really true? Probably not - keep the community spirit in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">High-Level View:</span> The longer you are in your field, the smaller it gets - you eventually will work together with many colleagues directly or indirectly. Also, chances are high that these people are like-minded, share similar backgrounds, etc. - would be a shame to not connect to them!

                    <h4>SOS Guide if you are totally stuck.</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are really stuck and have no idea what to do next, here some instructions to get out of this:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Define the problem / task you want to work on. No idea here? Then go through the latest CVPR/ICCV papers and observe where your curiosity is triggered.</li>
                        <li>Identify the groundbreaking method / idea that many of current approaches build on (examples could be ONet for 3D Reconstruction, NeRF for View Synthesis, the DDPM paper for modern diffusion models, etc).</li>
                        <li>Now, you have two possibilities:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Reimplement the method. Important for this approach is that you select a ground-breaking work, not a highly-tuned method with many bells and whistles - implementing the basic method is where you learn the most!
                                </li>
                                <li>Identify a clean and popular repository implementing the method.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Analyze where this method fails. For me, approaches that worked well are: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Check out the performance for “new” inputs.
                                </li>
                                <li>Order the predictions for the “default” inputs by some metric/score, and look at the worst.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Identify interesting failure cases, implement a metric to evaluate these cases, and start optimizing the method on these outputs!

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Of cause, this approach does not always lead to perfect research papers, but it worked for me in the past and it’s might be a way of getting yourself un-stuck!

                    <h4>Final remark: Sucess is not linear.</h4>
                    <p> Keep in mind that success is not a linear function of time, efforts, money, etc. - it's very hard to quantify. By far the best reference point is you, your past self, you health and your happiness.
